\chapter{Technology and Components}
\par This chapter will give a detail view of the technology we used for the ASIC. It is very important to get familiar with the properties of components used in the design. Since functionality of current version has been verified, in this dissertation, we will focus on the optimization. Noise, mismatches between channels and noise coupling are the main issues to be discussed.
